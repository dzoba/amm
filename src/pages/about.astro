    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      My name is Chris. I'm not a philosopher or an academic. I'm someone who spent
      a long time asking "what should I be doing?" and couldn't find an answer that
      held up to scrutiny.
    </p>

    <p>
      This framework is what I arrived at. It's my best attempt at an honest answer to
      the question that won't go away. I wrote it down because the idea itself demands
      to be shared &mdash; if the purpose of life is to discover the purpose of life, then
      getting more people thinking about it is part of the work.
    </p>

    <p>
      This writing is in its early stages. The argument needs sharpening, the
      implications need exploring, and there are counterarguments I haven't addressed
      yet. That's by design &mdash; I'd rather publish something imperfect and iterate
      with feedback than wait until it's perfect in isolation.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have thoughts, pushback, or questions, I genuinely want to hear them.
      This idea gets better the more people engage with it.
