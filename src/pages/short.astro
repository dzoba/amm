        Nobody knows what we're supposed to be doing. Not your parents, not
        philosophers, not religious leaders, not scientists. Everyone's working
        from the same uncertainty.
      </p>

      <p>
        That leaves two possibilities. Either there's a right way to live and we
        haven't found it yet. Or there isn't one at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        If there's no right thing to do, nothing matters. Any choice is as good
        as any other. That's logically consistent, but it's a dead end. You
        can't build a life on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        But if there <em>is</em> a right thing to do and we don't know what it
        is, then the only move that makes sense is to try to figure it out.

      <p class="thesis">The purpose of life is to discover the purpose of life.</p>

      <p>
        That's not a tautology. It's the one conclusion that survives the
        uncertainty. We don't know what we should be doing &mdash; so the most
        defensible thing we can do is search for the answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        And you can't lose. If the answer exists and we find it &mdash;
        extraordinary. If it doesn't exist, we're no worse off than if we'd
        never looked. Hope isn't naive here. It's the only position with any
        upside.
      </p>

      <p>
        This changes how you make decisions. Every choice that opens doors is
        better than one that closes them. Meet your base needs so you can focus
        on the search. Build resources &mdash; not as an end, but as a platform.
        Work together, because this problem is bigger than any one person or
        lifetime. And share the framework, because explaining it multiplies the
        effort.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's the whole idea. If you want the full argument &mdash; the
        nuances, the objections, the practical implications &mdash;
