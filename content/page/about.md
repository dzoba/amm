Hi, my name is Chris.  I developed this idea in an effort to 'know thyself'.  Its the only explanation and justification I have for what to do next.

As you can tell, things are in an early draft state here.  There is considerable more writing to do.  Feedback from folks like yourself is helping me decide which parts to write next.

I'd love to hear your thoughts.  Feel free to comment at the bottom of the writing, or, email me: ![my email](https://services.nexodyne.com/email/customicon/5FM5dF5uC%2Biw5bnsj9HV/u7nvJhs%3D/000000/ffffff/ffffff/0/image.png)
